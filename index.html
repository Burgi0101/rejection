            <p>Rejection Therapy is a social self-help game created by Jason Comely where being rejected by another person or
                group is the sole winning condition. The player can attempt any kind of social rejection, or try a suggestion
                from one of the Rejection Therapy suggestion cards available. The game can be played for any length of time,
                although many undertake the 30 Day Challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of playing the game is to overcome the fear of rejection through controlled, forced exposure. By this means,
                players hope to adapt physically to the stresses of rejection.
